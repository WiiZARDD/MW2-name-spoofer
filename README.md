# Getting Started
    
`Open .sln with Visual Studio 2019`

`Compile batch build x86 to create .EXE`
		
`Launch Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 (iw4mp.exe)`
		
`Run .EXE as administrator`

		
# Background
    
I had Missouri's name change source where I had discovered CiD stealers, Bugs, Typos, etc... I have decided to stabalize the build for re-release, credits to me because you're SKIDDED :)
